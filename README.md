# create a bot token

talk to: BotFather
Bot usernames always end in 'bot' (e.g. @TriviaBot, @GitHub_bot).

Use the /newbot command to create a new bot. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username, 
then generate an authentication token for your new bot.
The name of your bot is displayed in contact details and elsewhere.
